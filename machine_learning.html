            <h1>Machine Learning</h1> 
            <p>“Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence. It focuses mainly on the designing of systems, thereby allowing them to learn and make predictions based on some set of matrices in machines”.</p>

            <p>Traditionally, humans have analyzed data and adapted their culture from their past data. However, as the volume of data exceeds the ability for the human approach, it becomes possible to quickly and automatically produce models that can analyze bigger, more complex data and deliver faster, more accurate results – even on a very large scale.</p>

            <p>One of the approaches is where the machine learning algorithm is trained using a labelled or unlabelled training data set to produce a model. New input data is introduced to the ML algorithm and makes a prediction based on the model, the prediction is then evaluated for accuracy and if the accuracy is acceptable the machine learning algorithm is deployed.</p>

            <h1>Types of Machine Learning</h1>
         <h2>1. Supervised Machine Learning</h2>
         <p>
            In supervised learning, you train your model on a labelled dataset that means we have both raw input data as well as its results. We split our data into a training dataset and test dataset where the training dataset is used to train our network whereas the test dataset acts as new data for predicting results or to see the accuracy of our model.

 

            Hence, in supervised learning, our model learns from seen results the same as a teacher teaches his students because the teacher already knows the results. Accuracy is what we achieve in supervised learning as model perfection is usually high.
            
             
            
            The model performs fast because the training time taken is less as we already have desired results in our dataset. This model predicts accurate results on unseen data or new data without even knowing a prior target. In some of the supervised learning models, we revert back the output result to learn more in order to achieve the highest possible accuracy.
            
             
            
            For each input instance an expected value associates, the value can be discreetly presenting a category or it can be real or continuous value. The algorithm learns the input patterns that generate the expected output and now once the algorithm is trained it can be used to predict the correct output of a never seen input.
         </p>

         <h2>2. Unsupervised Learning</h2>
         <p>In unsupervised learning, the information used to train is neither classified nor labelled in the dataset. Unsupervised learning studies on how systems can infer a function to describe a hidden structure from unlabelled data. The main task of unsupervised learning is to find patterns in the data.

 

        Once a model learns to develop patterns, it can easily predict patterns for any new dataset in the form of clusters. The system doesn’t figure out the right output, but it explores the data and can draw inferences from datasets to describe hidden structures from unlabeled data.</p>

        <h2>3. Reinforcement Learning</h2>
         <p>It is a Machine Learning algorithm that allows software agents and machines to automatically determine the ideal behaviour within a specific context to maximize its performance. It does not have a labelled dataset or results associated with data so the only way to perform a given task is to learn from experience.

 

        For every correct action or decision of an algorithm, it is rewarded with positive reinforcement whereas, for every incorrect action, it is rewarded with negative reinforcement. In this way, it learns which actions are needed to perform and which are not. Reinforcement learning can, therefore, help in industrial automation as well as the gaming sector primarily.</p>
